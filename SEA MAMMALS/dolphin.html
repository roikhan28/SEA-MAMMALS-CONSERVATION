    Dolphins are one of the mammals that live in the sea or we usually call mammals. Dolphins need to rise to the surface to breathe to stay alive. Dolphins breathe through air holes located above their fists. Its slippery and slender body is perfect for swimming.<br><br>
    Dolphins are relatives of whales and porpoises. There are more than 40 types of dolphins. Dolphins live and work in groups or so-called flocks. They often play together. A dolphin cannot sleep well under water. It can drown. Therefore, he half sleeps some time a day. Dolphins eat squid and fish such as gray mullet. Sometimes dolphins herd flocks of fish to make them easy to catch.
    Dolphins find their way by sending sounds in the water. If the sound hits an object, it will be reflected back as an echo.<br><br>
    
    Dolphins are highly intelligent marine mammals, besides the natural systems that complement their bodies are complex. So a lot of technology is inspired by dolphins. One example is dolphin skin that is able to minimize friction with water, so dolphins can swim with little water resistance.
    This is what swimmers use to design swimsuits that resemble dolphin skin.</section>
