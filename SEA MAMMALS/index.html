  <h3>> What is a marine mammal?</h3>
  <p>They must meet the characteristics of all mammals — they breathe air through lungs, 
    are warm-blooded, have hair (at some point during life), 
    and produce milk to nurse their young — while also living most or all of their lives in or very near the ocean.<hr></p>

        <h3>DOLPHIN</h3>
        <p>Dolphins are a type of mammal that lives in water. There are many types of dolphins, one of which is the pink dolphin that lives in the Brazilian Amazon forest. Even though dolphins are classified as fish, they can give birth and have nipples, so they are called mammals. Dolphins live in groups. Dolphins are often called intelligent animals and are close to humans.</p>

    <h3>> Marine mammal ecology</h3>
    <P>Marine mammals represent a variety of ecological roles, including herbivores (manatees), filter feeders (baleen whales), and top predators (killer whales). Mammals evolved on land around 160 million years ago. Each taxonomic marine mammal group evolved from a different group of land mammals, whose ancestors separately ventured back into the ocean environment. Despite these different origins, many marine mammals evolved similar features — streamlined bodies,  paddle-like limbs and tails — through convergent evolution.

          <h3>WHALE</h3>
          <p>Whales are a group of mammals that live in the ocean. Whales do not belong to the fish family. Whales have the characteristic of breathing using lungs,
            has hair (few, mostly present in adult whales), is warm-blooded, has mammary glands, and has a heart with four chambers

      <h3>Threats and protection</h3>
      <p>
        Threats to marine mammals are largely from human impacts, including accidental capture in fishing gear, habitat destruction, poaching, pollution, harassment, and ship strikes. All marine mammals in waters of the United States are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). NOAA Fisheries collaborates with several partners to protect these species. Anyone can help protect marine mammals by showing proper ocean etiquette. Admire them from a distance; never touch, feed, harm, or swim with a marine mammal.</p>

          <h3>PORPOISES</h3>
          <p>Porpoise, (family Phocoenidae), specifically, any of seven species of toothed whales distinguishable from dolphins by their more compact build, generally smaller size (maximum length about 2 metres, or 6.6 feet), and curved blunt snout with spatulate rather than conical teeth. In North America the name is sometimes applied to dolphins. The porpoise family consists of three genera: Phocoena, Phocoenoides, and Neophocaena. </p>

  <h3>EDUCATION CONNECTION</h3>
    <p>The education resources in this collection provide educators and students opportunities to explore the adaptations, population dynamics, ecology, threats, behaviors, and anatomy of marine mammals. This collection includes resources to help students better understand the biology of marine mammals as well as their role in protecting these species.
