Whales are a group of mammals that live in the ocean. Whales do not belong to the fish family. Whales have the characteristic of breathing using lungs,
has hair (few, mostly present in adult whales), is warm-blooded, has mammary glands, and has a heart with four chambers

Ancient whales evolved in the middle of the Eocene, approximately 50 million years ago. One of the earliest extinct whales was Basilosaurus which had a small head with a prominent snout and teeth. Basilosaurus was 25 meters long. Another possible animal that turned into a whale is Ambulocetus, a mammal the size of a seal but 3 meters long and weighing 325 kilograms.

Currently there are two groups of whales, namely toothed whales (Odontoceti) and toothless whales (Mysticeti). The toothed Odontoceti whale is a predator that feeds on fish, cuttlefish and marine mammals, having one breathing hole. Toothed whales are closely related to dolphins and porpoises. Toothless whales are larger than toothed whales and have a brush-shaped structure known as baleen. This structure is useful for filtering plankton, its food, in the water. Balancing whales have two breathing holes</article>
